0.3.4	Added new class (VCorsikaSimulationData). This class can be used to add
	a new bank with additional information to VBF files generated from
	simulated showers (height and depth of first interaction,
	CORSIKA run number, CORSIKA shower ID).
	Also, short test programs to write/read this information.

0.2.1   Fixed bug in compression of traces where the number of samples is
	not a multiple of 8.  Fixed vbfZeroSup problems when sample compression
	is used.  Fixed vbfZeroSup's default pedestal event type.

0.2.0   Added support for new data format.  Added support for gzip
	decompression.  Added sample compression and a utility called vbfZip
	that controls it.  Changed the API to better handle the two formats.

0.1.5   Slight modifications to support better versioning.

0.1.4   Inclusion of two new tools: vbfPed and vbfZeroSup.  No longer using
	libtool to build libraries - instead building static libs.  This is an
	unfortunate work-around for a Mac OS X linker bug.  One side-effect is
	that the 'install' target will remove all libVBF*.so and libVBF*.dylib
	from your lib/ directory.  This removal step is necessary because most
	linkers will pick the dynamic library before going to the static one,
	meaning that your old VBF installation would override the new one.

	Also included simplification of VGPSDecoder API, making it more
	straight-forward to use it with VEvents.

	The final 0.1.4 release will include a complete clean-up of the code
	that deals with the GPS time, GPS year, and event type.  Currently,
	the only reliable way of getting those fields is through the array
	trigger.

0.1.3   Minor bugfix releases.
0.1.2
0.1.1

0.1.0   Changed the names of files to better comply with VERITAS conventions.
        Imported JQ's prototype data reader and made it compatible with VBF.
        Hence, it is now possible to use VRawDataFileRead to read VBF files.
        It is also possible to use VRawEventParser to read VEvents extracted
        from VPackets.

0.0.1   Contains changes to accommodate the addition of the configuration mask
        to the VBF header (suggested by Ozlem and Rene) as well as the addition
        of the telescope_id field in the telescope sub-structure of the
        VArrayTrigger.  Also includes better code for managing the
        configuration mask as a vector< bool > rather than as an integer.  To
        make the installation quicker, this release also contains a more
        streamlined Makefile.am that will not build datum_make unless it is
        really required.
        
        (NOTE: this release contains non-backwards-compatible changes to the
        data format.  Hopefully this'll be the last time I'll have to do that.)

0.0.0   First release.  Decoupled VBF code from the rest of the Purdue VERITAS
        package.  Added some nifty examples.

Welcome to the VBF examples!  These examples are meant to serve as templates
for programs that you would wish to write that use VBF.  Below you'll find some
instructions for how to get started with these examples.

First, you need to install VBF so that it is in your path.  Read the INSTALL
file in the base directory of the VBF distribution to learn how to do this.

After you've installed VBF, you should be able to build these examples by doing:

$ make

in the examples/ directory.

The examples that get built are:

PrintEvents           This program takes the name of a file and a telescope
                      number and prints all of the events in that file that
                      were generated by the given telescope.  This program is a
                      great starting place for writing analysis codes.

PrintSpecificEvent    This program takes the name of a file, a telescope
                      number, and an event number and prints out the event with
                      that event number that was generated by that telescope.
                      This program is a great starting place if you want to
                      understand how to do random access on a VBF file.

MakeBogusFile         This program generates a file with 1,000 bogus array
                      events, each containing seven events, an array trigger,
                      plus a simulation data structure.  This program is a
                      great starting place for integrating simulation code with
                      VBF.

ProtoEventPrint       Updated version of eventPrint from John Quinn's prototype
                      data reader package.  This demonstrates how with very few
                      changes, you can make your code use VBF.

ProtoEventCount       Updated version of eventCount from John Quinn's prototype
                      data reader package.  This demonstrates how with very few
                      changes, you can make your code use VBF.

PrintGPSTime          A portion of ProtoEventPrint that just prints the GPS
                      time.  This was a test used in some bug fixing.

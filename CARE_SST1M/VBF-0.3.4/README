Thanks for downloading VBF!

Installing VBF is easy. If you downloaded the tarball distribution of VBF,
simply do the following:

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/veritas
$ make
$ su
# make install

If you checked out the VBF source from CVS then you will have to generate
the .configure script first. Do:

$ ./autogen.sh

and then follow the instructions above.

If you want all of the gory details of how to do the installation, read the
INSTALL file.

If you want to learn who made VBF, read the AUTHORS file.

If you want to learn what the license for VBF is, read the COPYING file.

If you want to learn how to use VBF, look into the examples directory.  Read
examples/README and then start poking around in the code.

If you want to learn all of the details about what you can do with VBF, look
at the header files in this directory.  Most of them have very nice comments.

If you want to use this library to examine and manipulate VBF files, you can
use the seven programs that come with this package and will get installed
wherever:

vbfSummary          Prints summary information about a file, such as its run
                    number, the number of packets that it contains, and so on.
                    Only prints info that is available in the header.  Hence
                    this program is typically very fast.

vbfList             Lists all of the packets in a file.  Prints the names of
                    the banks contained in those packets.  Does not print the
                    contents of any of the banks.

vbfCheck            Verifies the checksum in a file.  Can either verify the
                    checksum that is contained inside the file, or can verify
                    that the file passes a checksum that you pass as an
                    argument.

vbfReindex          Rebuilds a file's index and checksum.

vbfPed              Calculates pedestals over a sample range.  You get one
		    pedestal value and standard deviation per channel,
		    representing the accumulated statistics over all samples
		    in that range for all FADC traces for that channel.  This
		    tool will analyze data from all telescope simultaneously.

vbfZeroSup	    Performs software zero-suppression based on a file that
		    contains zero-suppress thresholds.  You can create such a
		    file yourself, or you can use vbfPed and vbfCalcThreshold
		    to get the file.

vbfCalcThreshold    Reads in a pedestals file and spits out a thresholds file,
		    based on a ratio supplied by the user.

vbfRepTel           Creates 'fake' stereo data by replicating the data for a
                    particular telescope.

vbfZip              Compresses or decompresses event data using sample
                    comrpession.
